# Personal Portfolio

A static website that serves as a personal portfolio and a showcase of my coding skills. I designed the UI, used semantic HTML, modern CSS (flexbox, fluid typography, animations) following the BEM methodology, and vanilla JavaScript for the hand-coded project.

## Installation

After cloning the repository, run npm to install all the required modules.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Running `gulp` will begin the process of watching all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and sync any changes to be immediately visible in the browser.

```bash
gulp
```
